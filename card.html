			<p class="information">This dometiscated cat, is a profesional in the sport of window watching. She can spend long hours looking out the window, and simply dwell in constant <em>self-reflections,</em> questions arise
       about life and its simple human complications; she finds these meanderings just too boring. It is no secret that she has been caught in the past, mocking her roommates; she has been seen rolling around on the floor in laughter just watching them trying to lose weight, when they work out for only ten cat minutes!!, and then stuff their tummies with fat free burgers. People that pass by the street, have overheard her say:<em>"miaou!,miaou!!!,miaou, miaaaaoooouuuu!!!!..."</em>(she is part French you know), which in English would translate to: <em>"It's a hard-knock life for us!,It's a hard-knock life for us!... 'Steada treated, WEEE!! get tricked!".</em> It is believed that domesticated cats, have the hardest life of all, as the old Korean proverd says: <em>"Nyaong!, naong, nyaong nyaong."</em> (Korean cat talk not available for translation).</p>
